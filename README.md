# PyTorch Practice Collection
This repo is a personal collection of small, focused notebooks and code snippets used to test concepts, prototype ideas, and build intuition around PyTorch and deep learning workflows. It supports broader learning in machine learning, model interpretability, and reproducible experimentation.

# What's Inside
Each notebook represents a “practice bit” — a compact, self-contained exploration designed to:

* Demonstrate functionality (e.g., tensor operations, broadcasting, autograd),
* Prototype workflows (e.g., GPU setup in Colab, model scaffolding), or
* Serve as reusable logic in larger modeling pipelines.

Notebooks are annotated with markdown cells that walk through the concepts and show how the code applies to real use cases.

# Practice Bits

(More bits coming soon — model training, autograd, and loss functions)

# Purpose
This repo is meant to be:

* A scratchpad for learning and experimentation,
* A modular reference for PyTorch syntax and workflows,
* A foundation for building deeper modeling projects.
